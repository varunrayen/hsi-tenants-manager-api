## RULES
- Always prefer best practices of NodeJS, Typescript, Express, Mongoose, etc.
- Keep the Postman collection updated with the latest API endpoints.
- Don't add unnecessary comments in the code.
- Use the centralized config file (src/config/config.ts) for all environment variables instead of direct process.env access.
